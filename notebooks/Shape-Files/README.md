# Shape files
This directory contains three example shape files that are used for examples. Please do not add new ones to this directory because we want to keep the git repository for code only. You can use cloud buckets or zenodo to store larger datasets. 

The examples networks include:
- Amsterdam canal network, interesting for in city problems (last mile, electric ships)
- Rottterdam - Antwerpen, interesting for inter city problems (port to port, locks)
-
