    "We first need to create a 1D network (a graph) along which the vessel will move. A graph contains edges (blue dots in plot below) and vertices (black lines in plot below). For this example, we will construct a network consisting of 4 nodes in a straight line. Since we would like to have two-way traffic, we add two edges between each pair of nodes: one from left to right, and another the other way around (however, we could easily apply one-way traffic as well by remove one of the two edges). Consequently, we arrive at a total of 4 nodes, and 6 edges.\n",

    "Due to the nature of discrete modelling in which the time step is dependent on the activities (in this example: forcing a ship to move from node to node from its origin to its destination), it is important to add OpenTNSim mix-ins to the nodes in such a way we could identify the node (mix-in Identifiable, which imports a name and imports/creates an ID), and to locate the node (mix-in Locatable, which gives the node a geometry)."
