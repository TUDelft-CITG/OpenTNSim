    "### Create graph\n",
    "We first need to create a 1D network (a graph) along which the vessel will move. A graph contains edges (blue dots in plot below) and vertices (black lines in plot below). For this example, we will construct a network consisting of 4 nodes in a straight line. Since we would like to have two-way traffic, we add two edges between each pair of nodes: one from left to right, and another the other way around (however, we could easily apply one-way traffic as well by remove one of the two edges). Consequently, we arrive at a total of 4 nodes, and 6 edges.\n",
