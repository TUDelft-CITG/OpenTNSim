# The data (a**) are used for calculate accelerated velocity at the
# ship bottom due to shallow water effect based on Karpov method
# described by van Terwisga (1989). The data points (a**) are picked
# up from the original hand drawing figure. The estimation of a**
# based on the Froude number ( Fn ) for different water depth and
# vessel draught ratios ( h0 / Ts ). Detailed information can be found
# from Segers (2021)
