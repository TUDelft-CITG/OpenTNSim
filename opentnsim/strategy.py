"""Sailing strategies in OpenTNSim.

The vessel-waterway interaction is complex, since the vessel's sailing behaviors are influenced by not only the changing waterway situations along the route, but also the varation of its own payload, fuel weight, velocity, engine power, etc. Therefore, to sail wisely and safely, it is necessary to formulate optimal sailing stratigies to achieve various sailing goals according to different needs.

This package combine with "optimal sailing stratigies notebook" provides stratigies for preventing ship grounding, optimizing cargo capacity, optimizing fuel usage, reducing emissions, considering sailing duration, etc.
"""

# To Do in this pacakge:
# 1) add "burning lighter" function to monitor the fuel weight decreasing along the route. For the battery-container or electricity powered vessel, the "fuel weight" is constant.
# 2ï¼‰add "refueling heavier" function to show the fuel weight increased again at the refueling stations. For the battery-container or electricy powered vessel, the "fuel weight" is constant.
# 3) add "get_fuel_weight" function which call both the "burning lighter" and "refueling heavier" functions to take into account the influence of the variation of fuel weight to the actual draught and payload.
# 4) add "get_refueling_duration" function. For the battery-container, the duration is the unloading and loading time for the battery-containers.
# 5) add "get_optimal_refueling_amount" function. It's not always beneficial to be fully refueled with fuel for sailing, since more fuel on board leads to less cargo and there might still be residual fuel in the tank after a round trip if refuel too much. Therefore, it's needed to calculate the optimal refuling amount for each unique sailing case (route, vessel size & type, payload, time plan, refueling spots along the route).  The optimal refueling amount for a transport case determined by both the fuel consumption in time and space and the locations of refuling spots.
# 6) consider writting the "fix power or fix speed" example which is in the paper as a function into this pacakge in the future or Figure 10 -12 notebooks are enough already? What might it benefit if adds this function?
# 7) consider moving h_min calculation from core.py into strategy.py, since h_min is for strategy. But is it do-able? Any undesired influence to other calculations?

# 8)fix error of payload_2_T functions in strategy.py
